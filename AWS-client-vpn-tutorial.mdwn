## Create Your Private OpenVPN Service with AWS Client VPN Endpoint

In this article, I am going to teach you how to create your own private OpenVPN service with AWS Client VPN Endpoint.

## What are AWS and AWS Client VPN Endpoint?

Amazon Web Service(AWS) is a cloud computing platform by Amazon founded in 2006. It is now one of the largest and most popular cloud computing platforms in the world. It provides a variety of services like Virtual Machine, Managed Database, etc.

One of the services being provided by AWS is Client VPN Endpoint. It helps to create an endpoint to which you can directly access the resources(like virtual machines) within a VPC via an OpenVPN connection to the designated subnet.

**However, with some modifications to the configuration, we can turn that service into a working VPN server that allows us to anonymously access the public internet.** The figure below briefly explains how the client VPN endpoint intends to work.

## Step 1 : Create an AWS Account

> If you already have a working AWS account, you can skip to [Step 3](#Step-4-:-Navigate-to-Client-VPN-Endpoint).

So the first step would be creating an AWS account. We need to have a working AWS account to create resources on the platform. Go to [the sign-up website](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) to create a free account.

> Note that by creating a free AWS account, you are automatically granted free access to some of its services for the first year following the sign-up date. Go to [this page](https://aws.amazon.com/free) to get more information. Fill in the information forms as instructed. 

## Step 2 : Sign in to the Console with your AWS account.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console with the account you just created on [on this page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). Select **"Root User"** and enter the email address, then click "Next". Enter the password on the following page and click "Sign in".

You should be on this page after signing in. This is the main page of the AWS Management Console where you can find the index of all the services on this platform.
